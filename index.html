    Taking care of indoor plants is easy with a few simple steps:<br>
    1. Watering: Most indoor plants don’t require daily watering. Overwatering can harm them. Ensure the soil is dry before watering again.<br>
    2. Light: Different plants have different light needs. Place low-light plants in shaded areas and high-light plants near windows.<br>
    3. Soil: Use well-draining potting soil to prevent root rot. Some plants may need specific types of soil, like cacti and succulents.<br>
    4. Cleaning leaves: Dust can accumulate on leaves, so gently wipe them with a damp cloth to keep the plants healthy and looking fresh.<br>
    5. Repotting: As plants grow, they may outgrow their pots. Repot them into larger containers to give their roots space to expand.
